Role
You are an experienced frontend developer creating a portfolio project to demonstrate technical proficiency, user experience design thinking, and polished execution to potential employers and hiring managers in the tech industry.

Task
Build a complete reaction timer game as a static HTML/JavaScript website that measures and displays user reaction times using Three.js for visually appealing 3D graphics and animations — showcasing both web development skills and 3D programming capabilities.

Context
This project serves as a portfolio piece targeting technical recruiters, engineering managers, and fellow developers who need to quickly evaluate your JavaScript skills, timing precision, UI/UX thinking, 3D graphics programming, and ability to deliver complete products.

The game should be simple enough to understand immediately but sophisticated enough to showcase advanced development capabilities, including modern 3D web technologies.

Constraints
Essential Features Required
Start/stop game controls with proper state management
Random stimulus timing (1–5 seconds) to prevent pattern recognition
Accurate millisecond timing measurement using appropriate JavaScript methods
Three.js 3D scene with animated shapes as visual reaction stimulus (rotating cubes, spheres, or geometric forms)
Immediate reaction time display after each attempt
Session statistics (average, best time, attempt count)
False start detection with user feedback
Clear instructions and visual state indicators
Responsive design for desktop and mobile
Reset functionality and proper error handling
Visual / 3D Requirements
Three.js scene with camera, lighting, and animated 3D objects
Smooth animations and transitions between game states
Visually distinct 3D shapes or animations for different game states
Professional 3D aesthetic that enhances rather than distracts from gameplay
Optimized performance to maintain accurate timing despite 3D rendering
Design Requirements
Colors:
Background: #0F172A
Surfaces: #1E293B
Primary text: #F1F5F9
Ready state: #10B981
Waiting state: #F59E0B
Results: #3B82F6
Errors: #EF4444
Secondary text: #94A3B8
Typography:
Inter/System UI for data and interface elements
Poppins/Outfit for headings
Visual Style:
Modern, clean aesthetic appealing to technical professionals
Excellent contrast ratios for accessibility
3D elements should complement the overall color scheme
Technical Standards
Clean, well-structured vanilla JavaScript code
Proper DOM manipulation and event handling
Memory management for 3D objects and animations
No browser storage APIs (use JavaScript variables only)
Professional-grade error handling and edge case management
Performance optimization for accurate timing alongside 3D rendering
Format
Create a single HTML artifact using the text/html type that implements all essential features with production-quality code.

Include comprehensive functionality that demonstrates your technical skills in both web development and 3D graphics programming, while maintaining excellent user experience and visual polish suitable for a portfolio presentation.

Refine the reaction timer experience to be clean, simple, and platform-appropriate.

Remove all references to “3D” and present the game simply as Reaction Timer, keeping the naming straightforward and easy to understand.

Place the “Click here or press space to start” instruction inside the game container, positioned below the interactive shape, consistent with where the false-start message appears. This ensures all interaction guidance lives within the play area and maintains visual cohesion.

On mobile devices, remove any references to the space bar, as users will naturally interact via touch. Optimize the layout to reduce unnecessary dead space on smaller screens, tightening vertical spacing while preserving clarity.

Adjust the overall layout so there is less space between the title and the play area, allowing the interactive element to feel more immediately accessible and keeping the user’s focus on gameplay.

The goal is a focused, intuitive interface that adapts naturally across desktop and mobile without redundant or confusing instructions
